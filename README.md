# Concurrency and Golang

This repository contains a slideshow (`index.html`) and example code for a talk on concurrency and Golang.



## Example Code

We'll be going over several different ways to download large numbers of files over the internet.

Code in `synchronous/`, `10workers/`, `100workers/` and `routine_per_cat/` all contain various implementations of using or not using concurrency.
We'll examine their performance while downloading 540 cats from Imgur.
